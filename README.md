# SVD-Implementation-for-Recommender-Systems

This repository demonstrates *Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)* for recommender systems
using three progressively advanced approaches.  
The notebooks are designed for *conceptual clarity, **mathematical understanding, and **practical implementation*.

### 3️⃣ Truncated SVD (Scikit-learn)
- Dimensionality reduction using Truncated SVD
- Applied to sparse user–item rating matrices
- Suitable for large-scale recommender systems

⸻

📊 Dataset
	•	MovieLens 100K (Mirror sample used for visualization)
	•	Sparse user–item rating matrix

⸻

📈 Evaluation
	•	RMSE computed on known ratings to measure reconstruction error.

⸻

🧠 Key Idea
	•	Full SVD → exact reconstruction
	•	Truncated SVD → latent factors + better generalization

⸻

🎯 Use Case
	•	Academic posters
	•	Learning recommender systems
	•	SVD intuition and practice
